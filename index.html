            <p id="tribute-info">Deadpool is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
                The character was created by Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld, and first appeared in New Mutants #98 in
                December 1990. In his comic book appearances, Deadpool is initially depicted as a supervillain of the
                New Mutants and X-Force, though later stories would portray him as an antihero. Deadpool is the alter
                ego of Wade Wilson, a disfigured mercenary with superhuman regenerative healing abilities. He is known
                for his tendency to joke incessantly and break the fourth wall for humorous effect.

                The character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media. In the 2004 series
                Cable & Deadpool, he refers to his own scarred appearance as "Ryan Renolds [sic] crossed with a
                Shar-Pei".[6][7] Reynolds himself would eventually portray the character in the X-Men film series,
                appearing in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), Deadpool (2016), and its sequel Deadpool 2
                (2018).[8][9][10] Reynolds attributes Cable & Deadpool #2 to what got him invested in the character and
                inspired him to bring the character to the movies.[11] He will continue playing the character in a
                upcoming third film set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
